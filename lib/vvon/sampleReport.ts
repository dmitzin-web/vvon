      whyItMatters:
        "When MDF baseboards are detached and reset during flooring or drywall repairs, existing caulk lines at the wall-to-trim transition and the trim-to-floor transition are routinely disturbed during removal. Reinstallation typically requires fresh caulk, nail-hole fill, and localised paint touch-up to restore a uniform appearance along the wall and trim transitions. Without this finish work, the reset trim reads as visibly disturbed under normal lighting despite the trim itself being reused.",

Without texture work, the finished repair plane reads visibly different from the undisturbed wall under raking light, even when the painted finish is otherwise uniform.

        "Per IICRC S500 guidance, when Cat-2 water has intruded a wall cavity, application of an EPA-registered antimicrobial is commonly part of the mitigation scope to limit secondary microbial amplification before reconstruction.

        "Industry guidance typically expects temporary floor protection on adjacent unaffected rooms during demolition and equipment placement to prevent secondary damage from foot traffic, equipment movement, and debris. Without protection, finished flooring in adjacent rooms can sustain scuffs, gouges, or moisture damage that becomes its own claim item or is absorbed by the property owner.",
